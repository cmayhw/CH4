# Welcome to the Fugitive Methane Containment Simulator, 
# developed by CC Lab intern Charlie Mayhew in summer 2021.

# The notebook below runs best through application/extension Voila — see
# https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html for information on installing.
# That said, it will work if you just execute each cell in order. 

# The IPython Widgets library I used is a little fussy, but I tried to make the code flexible enough
# for additional abatement options in the future.

# A few things are commented out (such as file saves), but this can easily be undone. — August 10, 2021.
